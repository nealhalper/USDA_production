Fruit and Vegetables

This analysis provides a look into land usage for fruit and vegetable production in the United States. Focusing on the areas in production for fruits and vegetables will result in the identification of growth or decay in domestic food production. This will take into account the number of operations as well as acres in production to determine whether existing operations are growing larger or new producers are entering this industry.

Motivation 

I chose this project because my career path before attending Nashville Software School was in
agriculture. Specifically, I worked at farms/companies that grew fruits, vegetables and specialty
crops. This project should provide some insight into the larger trend of domestic food production.
